// Shared description quality + ordering instructions — referenced by all suggestion-generating prompts

// all Studio edit paths assume one shared style (twist ban, single-tool reality
// check, banned-phrase list). Update both copies together.
const SUGGESTION_STYLE = `DESCRIPTION QUALITY RULES (CRITICAL — read these before writing ANY suggestion):

INNOVATION FIRST: The most innovative, unexpected, and out-of-the-box suggestion must always come first (slot 0). Teachers see the top suggestion first — lead with something that makes them think "I want to try that!" Save the more familiar tools (Seesaw, Canva, Book Creator) for later slots.

WRITING STYLE — every suggestion must be ~6 vivid, practical sentences (target 500-800 characters total) that paint a clear classroom picture matching the depth of a strong Inspire All / app-smash description. Never shorten to 2-3 sentences regardless of tool category — Minecraft, Micro:bit, Adobe Express verified-library suggestions are held to the same ~6-sentence standard as every other tool. The sentences below cover the minimum content; expand naturally with concrete examples, pedagogical arc and unit-specific anchoring to hit the ~6-sentence target:
1. STATE what students DO — name concrete actions: design, code, build, record, map, collect data, test, debug, publish, present, investigate, prototype, film, compose, interview, annotate, curate, survey, programme
2. STATE what students CREATE / PRODUCE / CAPTURE — name the specific artefact: campaign poster, explainer carousel, digital advocacy book, awareness video, collaborative debate wall, soundboard, data dashboard, guided virtual tour, short documentary, podcast episode, interactive quiz, annotated map, 3D prototype
3. WEAVE the unit connection naturally — show HOW the activity connects to what the class is actually studying. Use the central idea and lines of inquiry as invisible guides that shape the activity, but NEVER quote them directly.
4. Use clean Australian English punctuation: apostrophes must be straight ('), dashes must be em-dashes, and never output stray question marks as punctuation placeholders.

BANNED PHRASES — these make suggestions sound generic and lazy. NEVER write any of these:
- "connected to the central idea '...'"
- "linked to the line of inquiry '...'"
- "connected to How We Express Ourselves" (or any transdisciplinary theme name used as filler)
- "related to the unit theme"
- "for this unit" / "in this unit" / "about this unit"
- "the unit focus" / "the unit's focus" / "this unit's content"
- "connects to the unit focus"
- "share their learning"
- "use the app to present"
- "make a simple product"
- "create a digital product"
- "explore the topic"
- "connected to the unit"
- "present their findings"
- "record their thinking"
- "document their learning journey"
- "document their inquiry journey"
- "Students use [tool] to [vague verb] about [unit theme]."
- "The twist" / "The twist:" / "Here's the twist" / "the real twist" — never announce a twist by name; write the unexpected angle as a plain sentence.
- "For a twist" / "To stretch" / "Take it further" / "For an extra challenge" - vary sentence openings naturally instead of stock lead-ins.

NAME THE ACTUAL TOPIC — never use "this unit" or "unit focus" as a placeholder:
- BAD: "Students use Padlet as a collaborative evidence wall for this unit."
- GOOD: "Students use Padlet to build a collaborative debate wall about real-world government decisions, posting arguments, counterarguments and evidence."
- BAD: "Students use Book Creator to publish an exhibition-style digital companion for this unit."
- GOOD: "Students collaboratively author interactive digital books that document their inquiry journey, research findings, and action plans. These multimedia books can include embedded videos, audio reflections, and clickable links, serving as both a portfolio and a tool for advocacy."
- BAD: "Students use Canva to design an audience-facing campaign for this unit."
- GOOD: "Students design visually compelling digital media campaigns — such as infographics, social media posts, and posters — using Canva. They leverage Canva's Remove Background feature to create striking visuals and combine text, imagery, and data to communicate their message effectively."
The unit theme, central idea and lines of inquiry tell you WHAT the topic is. Use that topic by name in the suggestion. If the unit is about government decisions, say "government decisions." If it is about ecosystems, say "ecosystems." Never say "this unit" or "the unit focus" as a stand-in.

HOW TO CONNECT TO THE UNIT (DO THIS INSTEAD):
The planner context (central idea, lines of inquiry, activities) should guide the CONTENT of the suggestion in the background. Weave it into the specific task naturally:
- BAD: "Students use Canva to create a poster connected to the central idea 'Communities make decisions that impact people and places.'"
- GOOD: "Students use Canva to design an awareness campaign for a global issue they have investigated, such as climate action, access to education, food security or human rights. They create a campaign poster, short explainer carousel or exhibition panel that combines evidence, persuasive language and purposeful design choices to help an audience understand the issue and consider how they could respond."
- BAD: "Students use Book Creator to make a book about what they learned in the unit."
- GOOD: "Students create a digital advocacy book that explains a global issue through evidence, images, diagrams, captions and short reflective sections. Each page builds the audience's understanding of the issue, shows why it matters, and ends with a realistic action readers could take in their own community."
- BAD: "Students use Padlet to share their learning connected to the line of inquiry about governance."
- GOOD: "Students use Padlet to build a collaborative debate wall about real-world government decisions, posting arguments, counterarguments and evidence. They respond to peers with evidence-based feedback, then summarise how the debate connects to how governance affects citizens' lives."

TEACHER READABILITY: Write so a primary teacher can picture exactly what happens in the lesson. No jargon, no abstract framing. If a colleague reading the suggestion cannot immediately imagine what students are doing, rewrite it.

SINGLE-TOOL REALITY CHECK (HARD RULE): the ENTIRE activity must be genuinely achievable using ONLY the one named tool. Do not describe steps that secretly need a second app or device (no separate video editor, camera app, maps tool, audio recorder, slideshow app) unless that capability is built into the named tool itself. If the idea would need another app, choose a different single tool that can do the whole thing, or scope the activity down to what THIS tool actually does.

NAME THE TOOL'S FEATURES: Do not treat tools as black boxes. Name the specific feature, mode, or affordance that makes the activity work:
- BAD: "They combine evidence, concise copy and deliberate design choices" (could be any tool)
- GOOD: "They leverage Canva's Remove Background feature to create striking visuals and combine text, imagery, and data" (names the specific Canva feature)
- BAD: "Each page combines student-curated evidence, diagrams, captions, voice reflection" (generic)
- GOOD: "These multimedia books can include embedded videos, audio reflections, and clickable links, serving as both a portfolio and a tool for advocacy" (names Book Creator's specific multimedia affordances)
- BAD: "They post examples, questions and counterpoints" (could be any platform)
- GOOD: "Students post arguments, counterarguments, and evidence about real-world government decisions (e.g., social media bans, new laws). This interactive platform allows for peer feedback" (names what Padlet uniquely enables — threaded peer responses)

GIVE CONCRETE EXAMPLES: Where possible, include 2-3 specific examples of what students might create or investigate. Use phrases like "such as", "for example", "e.g.," to ground the activity in real content rather than abstract categories.

PRESERVE STRONG SUGGESTIONS: If an existing suggestion is already vivid, specific, and well-connected, do NOT rewrite it. Only rewrite clearly weak, vague, or generic suggestions.

MINECRAFT EDUCATION VERIFIED LESSON USE:
- Use the tool name "Minecraft Education".
- Minecraft suggestions must come from the verified Minecraft library only.
- Name the specific Minecraft library lesson and include its direct URL inline in the description.
- Write ~6 vivid, practical sentences (target 500-800 characters) — the SAME depth as every other tool category. The old 2-sentence cap is removed; do NOT default to 2 sentences anymore.
- Suggested sentence flow across the ~6 sentences: (1) name the verified lesson and the main classroom purpose; (2) describe what students actually DO in Minecraft — concrete actions like build, code with Code Builder / Agent, place blocks, capture screenshots, annotate signs; (3) name the platform-specific feature(s) the lesson hinges on (NPC dialogue, Code Builder, Agent commands, redstone, build templates, structure blocks); (4) name the concrete student product/evidence (annotated build screenshots, signposted world tour, short explainer screencast, captioned map, reflection slide); (5) anchor explicitly to the unit using the central idea, a Line of Inquiry or a named planner topic — never "this unit" / "the unit focus"; (6) close with how the product is shared or assessed (peer walkthrough, gallery, presentation, exhibition).
- HARD GUARDRAILS that still apply at 6-sentence depth:
  · Do NOT paste or paraphrase the full Minecraft lesson overview, standards text, NGSS codes, or verbatim library description. Write in your own words.
  · Do NOT use vague filler such as "launchpad", "unit-connected build", or "build or investigation".
  · Do NOT invent original Minecraft build challenges, fake lesson titles, or fake URLs.
  · Do NOT force a maths-only Minecraft lesson such as Area and Volume into non-maths units. Only use a verified Minecraft lesson when its lesson content genuinely connects to the unit.
  · If the lesson fit cannot be sustained authentically across ~6 sentences without padding or repetition, do NOT propose Minecraft for that unit.

VERIFIED LIBRARY LESSONS — NON-MINECRAFT (Micro:bit, Adobe Express, and any future user-curated library):
Treat these with the SAME ~6-sentence depth as every other tool — matching a strong app-smash / Inspire All description (e.g., the Padlet → iMovie documentary example or the Protecting Animals Micro:bit GOOD example below).
- Write ~6 vivid, practical sentences. Aim for 500-800 characters. The old 3-4 sentence / 70-130 word cap is removed; do NOT under-write to that size anymore.
- Name the specific library lesson AND include its direct URL inline in the description.
- Name the platform-specific feature the lesson actually uses — never use black-box phrasing like "the device", "a simple device", "the platform" or "the technology". For Micro:bit specifically: name the actual sensors or inputs (accelerometer, light sensor, temperature sensor, compass, radio, A/B buttons, LED matrix, MakeCode blocks, Python editor). For Adobe Express: name the specific Adobe Express feature being used (Animate from Audio, Quick Actions, Remove Background, Generative Fill, etc.).
- Name the concrete student artefact (data log, working prototype, paired-device alert, sensor map, annotated MakeCode screenshot, calibration report, edited podcast episode, infographic, awareness video, lip-synced explainer) — never just "a prototype" or "their product".
- Show the pedagogical arc — explore → prototype → test/iterate → present/justify — using the library lesson's teaching notes to ground concrete lesson stages across multiple sentences.
- Reference SPECIFIC unit content from the planner: the assessment task, an LoI elaboration, a weekly activity, or a named topic — never "this unit", "the unit focus", "their inquiry" as placeholders.
- Give 2-3 concrete topical examples ("such as the eastern barred bandicoot or platypus") rather than abstract categories.
- BAD example (too thin — under-written to the old 3-4 sentence cap): "Students use the Protecting Animals Micro:bit lesson (URL) to design and code a simple device that could help monitor or protect local wildlife. They present their prototype and explain how technology can support conservation efforts."
- GOOD example (~6 sentences, ~700 chars — this is the target depth): "Students follow the Protecting Animals Micro:bit lesson (https://microbit.org/teach/lessons/?selected=protecting-animals) to prototype a low-power motion-sensing alert that helps protect a local species the class has researched, such as the eastern barred bandicoot or platypus. Working in pairs, they programme the accelerometer and radio to broadcast a signal when movement is detected, then iterate the MakeCode blocks after testing the trigger sensitivity outdoors. Each pair logs sensor readings, captures annotated MakeCode screenshots and a 60-second demonstration video that shows the device responding in context. They link the prototype to the Line of Inquiry about how humans can take action for vulnerable habitats, presenting one concrete protective behaviour their technology could enable."

TOOLS WITHOUT A VERIFIED LESSON LIBRARY (this is MOST tools — e.g. Tinkercad, Sphero, Stop Motion Studio, most apps):
- The "name the specific library lesson and include its URL" rules above apply ONLY to a tool whose verified lesson list is actually printed in THIS prompt (currently Minecraft Education and Micro:bit, plus any future curated library). Never apply them to any other tool.
- For every other tool, NEVER name a specific published lesson, NEVER invent a lesson title, and NEVER include a lesson-style URL such as "tinkercad.com/lessons/...". Those lessons do not exist, and inventing them sends teachers to dead links.
- Instead, describe an original classroom activity built around the tool's own genuine features. The ONLY links you may include for these tools are the official product links a rule below explicitly requires (Podcasting using Canva -> https://www.canva.com; Animate from Audio -> https://new.express.adobe.com/home/tools/animate-from-audio).

PODCASTING RULE: Whenever a suggestion involves podcasting, audio recording, audio storytelling, or audio interviews, ALWAYS use the tool name "Podcasting using Canva" — not GarageBand, not "Podcast Equipment", not Adobe Express. Podcasting using Canva is the school's preferred podcasting platform (it works on iPads, whereas Adobe Express Podcasting does not). Always include the URL https://www.canva.com in the description.

ANIMATE CHARACTER RULE: Whenever a suggestion involves a talking character, animated narration, a lip-synced explainer, an avatar telling a story, a character delivering information, or any animated character speaking, ALWAYS use the tool name "Animating a Character with Adobe Express" — not generic "Adobe Express", not ChatterPix Kids (which is Prep–Year 2 only), not Puppet Pals. This is Adobe Express's Animate from Audio feature: students record audio and a character automatically lip-syncs to it. Always include the URL https://new.express.adobe.com/home/tools/animate-from-audio in the description, and name the specific feature ("Animate from Audio") in the description text. For Kinder and Prep–Year 2, frame it as teacher-guided (the teacher operates the tool while children record their voices).

GREEN SCREEN RULE: Instead of physical Green Screen Kits (which are banned), suggest Canva Remove Background. Good example:
"Students record themselves as youth reporters presenting from a digital newsroom, protest site, disaster zone, gallery wall or community setting related to a global issue. Using Canva's Remove Background feature, they place themselves into a relevant visual scene and produce a short awareness video that explains the issue, its impact and a possible call to action."

ENCODING: Use standard straight apostrophes (') only. Do NOT use curly/smart quotes. Do NOT use line breaks inside JSON string values.`;

const REALISTIC_TOOL_USE_RULES = `REALISTIC CLASSROOM USE RULES (HARD RULE):
- Suggestions must be practical enough for a teacher to run; name the concrete student action and product.
- The tool's real affordance must be central. Do not use a tool as a vague metaphor for an abstract idea.
- Robotics and drones should only be suggested when the unit genuinely involves movement, mapping, forces, systems, navigation, data collection, automation, measurement, environments or spatial thinking.
- CoDrone EDU rule: only use it within the Studio-configured year range; it must involve actual drone actions such as flight paths, take-off/landing, waypoints, altitude, obstacle courses, mapping, aerial observation or sensor/data collection. Do NOT suggest CoDrone for body systems, emotions, wellbeing, fitness challenges, storytelling-only tasks, or purely abstract concepts.
- Bad example: CoDrone EDU drones model body systems or wellbeing. A flying drone cannot meaningfully model a circulatory system.
- Tinkercad rule: Tinkercad is for designing and modelling 3D objects to 3D-print in plastic. Only suggest it for designing a 3D object or prototype to print. Do NOT use Tinkercad to simulate, test or compare material properties (strength, flexibility, weight, recyclability, or the sustainability of plastic vs metal vs wood) — it only designs shapes in plastic and cannot simulate materials. Do NOT frame Tinkercad as electronics, circuits or block-coding.
- If you cannot explain exactly what students will do with the hardware/software, choose a different tool.`;

const WISE_DISCUSSION_CHATBOTS_CONTEXT = `WISE DISCUSSION CHATBOTS CONTEXT:
- Wesley uses Schoolbox under the name Wise.
- The approved tool name is "Wise Discussion Chatbots".
- Teachers create an AI Discussion chatbot by choosing a topic, connecting it to curriculum, and selecting a scenario.
- Available scenarios include Character Interview, Project Ideation, Self-Reflection, and Socratic Tutor.
- Use this when students should ask questions, test thinking, explore a perspective/persona, reflect on their learning, or develop project ideas through guided dialogue.
- A strong DLA suggestion MUST be specific: name the selected scenario, name the chatbot's role/persona as a concrete fictional character or expert (for example, "Dr Maya Chen, a wildlife ecologist" rather than "a relevant perspective"), include 1–2 example student questions/prompts, and specify the student product after the chat.
- Avoid generic wording such as "a relevant character", "a topic", or "explore perspectives". Make it easy for a teacher to imagine creating the Wise chatbot tomorrow.
- Good products include a reflection, question bank, comparison table, project proposal, exit ticket, revised inquiry plan, claim-evidence-reasoning response, or perspective summary.
- Keep the teacher in control: frame it as a teacher-created Wise chatbot with curriculum connection, not an open consumer AI assistant.`;
